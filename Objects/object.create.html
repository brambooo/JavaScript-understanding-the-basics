        Object.create is a method and another way of creating objects.
        Instead of this we could in my opinion better use object literals or constructor functions

        But it is always good to know that this is another way of creating objects!

        The bad thing about this way is that we have to add enumerable, writable and configurable key/value pairs for every property we add to the object...

        var person = Object.create(Object.prototype, {
            name: {
                value: 'Bram',
                enumerable:true,
                writable:true,
                configurable:true
            },
           age: {
               value: 23,
               enumerable: true,
               writable: true,
               configurable: true
           }
        })

        // Show properties of he object
        console.log(person.name);
        console.log(person.age);
