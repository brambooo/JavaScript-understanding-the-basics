            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }

        // This means that each of our Person objects has a property discount with a value 3
        Person.prototype.discount = 3;

        console.log(Person.prototype);

        // Objects that derive from the Person constructor function
        var bram = new Person('Bram', 23);
        var koen = new Person('Koen', 20);

        // It is possible to change the above declared prototype discount value only explicitly for a created object (in this case bram)
        // We didn't change here the prototype discount property. We added a new property to the bram object.
        // We could now access both values from the prototype discount property and the new declared discount property (see logging)
        bram.discount = 20;

        // Now we see at the logging that bram has a discount of 20 and koen 3.
        console.log(bram);
        console.log(koen);

        // Get both discount properties
        console.log('\nDiscount properties Bram:');
        console.log('Prototype discount property: ' + bram.discount);
        console.log('Nieuw discount property: ' + bram.__proto__.discount);

        // What we see here is that bram had in the beginning not a real discount property, the prototype only did.
        // But how could we still get access to a discount property when we call it on every object that we create of Person?
        // We could even check if a Person object e.g. Bram has a discount property:
        console.log('\nBram object keys:');
        console.log(Object.keys(bram));

        // We see here that it didn't have any discount property.
        // When we ask for a property and JS cannot find it at an object, JS ask then its prototype for the property.

        // We could check for a prototype property with this method:
        console.log('Controleren of Person prototype bepaalde properties heeft:');
        console.log('bram.hasOwnpropery(name)? '+ bram.hasOwnProperty('name')); // return true when the prototype has that property else flase
        console.log('koen.hasOwnpropery(discount)? '+  koen.hasOwnProperty('discount')); // return false because the prototype itself hasn't a discount property, we only added it to bram
