        // Code blocks are independently blocks between curly brackets
        // Keep in mind that those code blocks only run when we are inside of them. So when an expression is true or a function is called.

        // Block example as an if statement
        if(a > b) {
            console.log('A is greater than b');
        } // end block

        // While loop block example
        while(a <= 10) {
            console.log(a);;
            a++;
        } // end while loop block

        // Function block
        function callBram() {
            console.log('Call bram');
        }

        // Reminder, we can see a block just as independently code that only runs when we are inside of it.
